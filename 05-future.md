## Master

When I finish my bachelor, I want to follow up with the Master Program of Industrial Design at the TU/e.
Throughout the years I have learned a great deal about Industrial Design in general, but also specialty knowledge on the outer edges of the field.  

On a more personal level I became very proficient in Computer Graphics, Programming (Java, C, C++, C#, Python, Processing, GLSL, Arduino), Machine Learning, 3D printing & modelling, Raspberry Pi, VR. 
Having these acquired skills and knowledge regarding realisation and prototyping, I have a significant advantage in the design process. I can now focus solely on User & Society, Creativity & Aesthetics.
