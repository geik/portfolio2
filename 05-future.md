## Master

When I finish my bachelor, I want to follow up with the Master Program of Industrial Design at the TU/e.
Throughout the years I have learned a great deal about Industrial Design in general, but also specialty knowledge on the outer edges of the field.  

On a more personal level I became very proficient in Computer Graphics, Programming (Java, C, C++, C#, Python, Processing, GLSL, Arduino), Machine Learning, 3D printing & modelling, Raspberry Pi, VR. 
Having these acquired skills and knowledge regarding realization and prototyping, I have a significant advantage in the design process. I feel like I can finally realise the ideas I have, also inspired by existing literature, to a degree that I can test their viability. I can now focus solely on User & Society, Creativity & Aesthetics and Business & Entrepreneurship. 
My main focus is to improve my academic writing and researching. The simple fact is, I need more experience on this matter. I have always been put on the realisation tasks in team projects, since I was the only person who was not afraid to take that upon myself. In that process the task of writing and actual researching usually gets left for the other team members.
In the future I can play a  delegatory role when it comes to dividing and supervising tasks regarding T & R. I want to share my knowledge and skills with my team members, while they can guide me in improving my writing and researching skills.
