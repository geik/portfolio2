## Expertise areas

### Creativity & Aesthetics

When I started my Bachelor, I thought that I had a pretty solid background regarding creativity and manufacturing. But during the first year I found out that I was only at the very start of a journey and that there's a lot to learn.

I have learned to use a variety of tools, to see and use creativity as a process, how to shape a concept by exploratory sketching, how to turn a concept into a digital prototpye and to witness the beauty of interaction. 

During my Final Bachelor Project I have applied my CAD Modelling skills, which I acquired during my Bachelor. 

(Interaction Design ...)

###### Courses

From Idea to Design, Creative Programming, Creative Electronics, Creative Mechanical Engineering, Exploratory Sketching, Aesthetics of Interaction, Design for Games & Play I

### Technology & Realization

As a teenager, I sewed my own clothes, worked with wood, drew sketches and spray-painted.

At the TU/e I learned how to program (C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Arduino, Processing), how to make models in 3D and print these, how to design electronic circuitry (analog & digital) and how to solder and assemble these. I have created new ideas for the IoT and realised these myself and used Machine Learning to implement complex behaviour, learning from human input. 

###### Courses

From Idea to Design, Creative Programming, Creative Electronics, Creative Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Design, Design for Games & Play I, Technologies for Connectivity, Interactive Intelligent Products


### User & Society

Being graduated from high school student, I was just ...

Now I have gained more awareness on the variety of opinions, cultures, norms and values. To overcome these differences, I have improved my debating skills. On the other hand I became more couragous and deliberately triggered discussions on controversial ideas.  
I have learned to witness interaction on a purely abstract level, in order to create richer experiences.
This enables me to design interactions, which convey the design's values.

###### Courses

User-centred Design, Socio-cultural Sensitivity, USE Basics, Engineering Design, Aesthetics of Interaction, Design for Debate, Design < > Research, Aesthetics of Interaction
