## Expertise areas

### Creativity & Aesthetics

When I started my bachelor, I thought that I had a pretty solid background regarding creativity and crafting, but during the first year I found out that I was only at the very start of a journey and that I had a lot to learn.

I gained the ability to use a various array of tools to use in the creative process. I like to use these tools as a means to explore and shape a concept. Mainly through the use of rough exploratory sketches and spatial explorations. I like to sketch out my ideas to explore the different possible shapes, features and modalities. I can turn these rough ideas and sketches into a digital concept through CAD and computer modelling, from that point on I will turn those concepts into a tangible design through the use of 3D printing or woodworking to be able to witness the physical aspect of interacting with the concept.

I have always longed for a more engaging method to make compter models. Somethings which would allow me to brainstorm through modeling in a tangible manner. I have recently accuired a VR headset which alows me to do just that. I want to examine the characteristics of interacting with a model through seeing it in 3D space relative to your own size. Software called Adobe Medium allows me to achieve this very roughly. I don't have to make a model using Fusion 360 and then 3D print it to assess it, but I can now explore the shape more intuitively. This means I don't have to reprint and revise my CAD models all the time saving me a lot of time and resources.

During my Final Bachelor Project I have applied my knowledge and skills of these creative processes, which I have acquired during my Bachelor. I have explored the use of VR in aiding this process. I will continue to explore the possibilities of VR and AR modelling in my future projects.

### Technology & Realization

When I was younger, one of my first real creative hobbies was sewing. I also worked a lot with wood and such materials in highschool to create maquettes for various courses. I also liked to modify toys by giving them a custom look using different techniques of painting.

My realisition process was very much focussed on realizing my ideas about the aesthetic. I have always had ideas about what something should do and how it should work. My parents used to call me the "researcher" when I was a kid, becayse I was constantly trying to figure out what made my devices around me tick. I quickly discovered that most of my toys and such are driven electronics of some sort. My initial interest in electronics was sparked from a very young age. I also played a lot of video games when I was younger and always wondered how such complex behaviour could be achieved with these electroncis. This sparked an early interest in computer software and hardware.

At the TU/e I finally learned how to program these devices and softare which I have been wondering so long about. Mainly through programming with Arduino, C and C++ I learned a great deal about how the supposed barrier between the digital and physical is overcome. Through languages like Java, Processing and Python I learned more about how to create complex behaviour through creating software. I also worked with the C# language in the game engine Unity to develop video games. 

In order to expand my skillset in realizing physical representations of my concepts I learned how to work with Solidworks and Fusion 360 in order to create 3D models and I taught myself how to use and maintain 3D printers to create high fidelity prototypes from these models.

My journey into realising my ideas on how to design electronic circuits which achieve certain functionality started with the Physics and Creative Electronics courses. I can create basic funcionality through use of analog circuits, but more importantly use them in conjunction with existing digital microprocessors in order to achieve sensory input registration for the various input modalities for my protypes. 

I became very capable in soldering these circuits up to the point where a lot of people see me as the granddad of soldering. I can not only realize my own electronic imagination, I am always happy to help others out in realizing their wildest dreams they have regarding electronics and teach them how to use the different tools available so they can wield the soldering iron as their weapon. Many people view electronics as a very big demon to slay in their projects. I want to show people that it is not as hard as it might initially seem.

### User & Society

After graduating high school, I was very unaware of all the thought and knowledge which goes into designing a user friendly product. I looked at this process from a purely functional point of view. Going very literally from a need for a certain functionality to providing a solution which directly assesses that.

Starting my studies at Industrial Design, an interest was sparked in going beyond the purely functional aspects of a product and extending into making usability more pleasing and stimulating more senses. Gaining an expanded sense of awareness in the important values and characteristics surrounding userfriendliness in interfaces and interaction modalities, being able to get into the users skin and designing something which awnsers their needs. I also sought perspectives from others cultures, norms and values and even going across moral boundaries in exploring what is not always accepted, deemed incorrect or inaproriate in an attempt to spark debate surrounding what design should and should not address.

I also had the chance to experiment and experience different levels of abstraction in creating and analyzing models describing interaction between user and product or ecosystem in order to study them more thoughtfully. Various methods of studying users include, but are not limit to, questionnaires, interviews and usertests. Analyzing the results from those is important to be able to communicate and verify their outcomes.
Others approaches in more literally defining and testing how an imput modality should work can also be done using quantitative data. A very useful tool which I have picked up is machine learning, allowing gathered sensor and meta data from usertests to be used resulting in products which can react in a more seamless and smooth fashion compared to normal programming of software and devices. It allows for the tuning process to take vastly less time that classical methods.

I still have a lot to learn in terms of building up expiernce in this field though, since my expertises have always made me end up on the Technology & Realisation tasks in team projects. With my experience in that expertise I can now solely focus on working out User & Society aspects in my upcoming studying and working career.

### Business & Entrepreneurship

I was never into anything related to business or entrepreneurship. I always thought it mainly was about making money. For me the journey towards a goal and gratification from external parties weight much heavier than my personal materialistic gains. 

Because I needed to incorporate some form of business and entrepreneurship in my curriculum I looked at ways it could be tackled differently. I picked the USE trajectory Technology Entrepreneurship in order to learn more about it in general. I got introduced with venture entrepreneurship/capitalism through the introductory course Introduction to Technology Entrepreneurship. The second course Organizing Entrepreneurship dives deeper into the topic and introduces corporate structures and dives deeper into setting up business models by analyzing existing companies. The final course Entrepreneurship in Action takes everything from the previous courses and tasks you with proposing your own business model through a group project.

I learned a great deal about what setting up a business entails and what tools you can use to achieve just that. However, some of my prejudices about business and entrepreneuship were actually confirmed by what I have learned about it. According to the courses a succcesful corporation was primarily defined by it making money (apart from non-profit organisations), which is exacly what detered me from the topic in the first place.

Through this experience I strived to find a new kind of entrepreneurship which does not necessarily defines profit in terms of making money. I firmly believed you can also see it in a more societal perspective. An example: government businesses don't always need to make a profit because their expenses are covered by tax money, their "profit" is defined in how much value they create for society. 

I found a deepening course called Design for a Sustainable Future, which takes an in depth look at business model innovation. It looks at different alternative stratagies when it comes to defining a business model where profit is not purely defined in terms of money but also socio-cultural value is concidered as such as well as sustanibility. Multiple strategies are discussed like looking at waste streams in current business models and creating more value out of those; replacing industrial processes with natural and sustainable ones. It also looks into creating sustainable and socially responsible business models from the start.

I look forward into learning more about this topic in the future, particularly from the faculty of Sustainable Innovation. I will probably never be much of a real entrepreneur myself, but knowing what is going on in their field and being able to partake in the conversation striving towards a better future, together with others who are more at home in this field we can certainly help shape the entrepreneurial landscape for the upcoming generations.

### Math, Data & Computing

In high school I learned about basic maths and physics. I have always struggled with maths because it was relatively abstract compared to something like physics, which describes real world phenomena. Physics at uni was not a real challenge to me at all, since it just expanded on what I was taught in high school. Calculus provided me with an entirely new view on solving abstract math problems, because it focussed on the underlying priciples and theory instead of pushing you to just practice solving similar types of equations. It was still quite hard, but it would prove very useful in developing computer graphics which really sparks my fancy.

On the side of physics, I already had a pre-existing interest in creating electronic circuits in a more practical manner. In the course Applied Physics I was taught basic electronics theory, which sparked my interest in wanting to learn more about more advanced electronics in general. This promted me to take some first years courses from the electrical engineering faculty. 
Although I did not finish them or completed their exams in the end, due to them being very time consuming, I did sit out the entirety of their lectures. The courses in question were Circuits and Computation I: hardware/software interface. Circuits introduced me to the topic of transient circuits and AC circtuits and I learned how these behaved and theory in calculating this behaviour. 
The course Computation introduced me to the fundamentals of computer architecture and how computer programs are built up from the ground up, starting with a program written in C, that being compiled into Assembly and finally to an excecutable binary file. This course was very hard and time consuming because of the the aspects you had to learn about, which at this point was very foreign to me.
I can say that when I am writing computer programs in languages like C and C++, this knowledge about Assembly and the underlying computer architecture do come in very handy though. No need for complex abstractions to achieve certain functionality. I can now write computer programs which make use of the underlying hardware and limit computer and program memory usage if needed and optimise excecution time.

I always had a curiosity for the Internet of Things. That is why I decided to take a design project from the CRIGS squad. (See projects section, Upside Dawn) This project planted an initial awareness of the various array of problem encountered in designing for the IoT. You want a specific funcionality from you product, for which you would usually need a specific type of (sensor data) event to happen. The trick is to take your concept and simplify it to a degree where it does fit in an existing ecosystem of other devices which all have their own need for specific types of events. Another course which discusses this topic more in depth was Technologies for Connectivity, in which a soundscape was designed based on events which happen in the IoT landscape.
Although I don't think the attempts at creating an IoT artefact has thusfar been super novel, provide much utility or anything like that, although they did work up to a certain degree. It did plant seeds for me to be more aware of the different conciderations in designing for the IoT.

During the course Data Analytics I learned how to use Python in order to organise and analyse datasets of any kind and how to visualise those. I can derrive statistical significance from certain features in a dataset in order to quantify certain choices in a design process. During the course Making Sense of Sensors this topic was reintroduced through the lens of Industrial Design through sensor data implemented in products or artefacts. This created the link between design and data in order to be able to use data set features as an argument in some cases for your choices in the design process.
Another aspect to using sensor data in design is using it in an intelligent way as a form of user input. During the course Intelligent Interactive I learned how to use different machine learning techniques and algorithms on different types of data including but not limited to digital images and video, IMU sensors and sound and FFT spectrum analysis. You don't just learn how to implement these exact applications, you learn the theory behind these practical examples in order for yourself to be able to recognize opportunities for machine learnign to be applied in other context or design related problems. Apart from classical machine learning which is not able to adapt and learn on the go, you also learn about using neural networks in order to address this. This way a product can become truely "intelligent" and adapt itself to different situations not always accounted for in the original Design briefing.

During my master Industrial Design I would really like to explore the possibilities of what can and cannot be achieve using machine learning. I hope that with my knowledge and skills of computer hardware and programming I would be able to birng this to less computationally powerful platforms, so it can also be used without the need for a computer to be connected for performing the calculations. Together with the ever expanding set of devices and services which exist in the IoT ecosystem and on the internet in general, I think this is one of the most powerful tools when it comes to providing richer interaction from products, without the need for endless analysis or fine tuning of modalities, since you can use machine learning with a certain set goal and it will do its best in optimizing to achieve that.
