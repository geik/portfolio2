## Stream (Project B1.2)

Stream is an interactive experience to be installed in tunnels. The aim is to make tunnels for foot and cycling traffic safer. It will be discussed how Stream uses references from nature to create an atmosphere inside the tunnel that induces calmness. A turtle that is displayed on the wall leads people passing through by walking slightly in front of them. This creates a feeling of guidance and makes people feel less alone. Sounds of windchimes create a calming atmosphere, symbolising unity with the earth. Reflecting organic shapes create "echoes" of light, creating a unity and giving a cozy feeling. Prototyping of this product consisted of a mechanical prototype, a polished prototype using sensors, and an interactive virtual reality experience. This report discusses the process of going from the pressure-cooker to the final demo-day. The ideation process, use of user-tests, prototyping, iterations, teamwork, and reflection on the project will all be discussed further in-depth.

## Upside Dawn (Project B2.1)

The family that we have been designing for misses out on one another in the mornings. When Pierre awakens Bente is already on her way to work. In the weekends the family misses out on family time because each of them is unaware of the whereabouts of the others. Upside Dawn is a device that helps the family to feel more in touch with one another throughout the week. 

During the week family members can record personal messages for each other, which are played the following morning when the proposed receiver of the message opens their curtains. So despite the lack of physical proximity, a sense of intimate contact is provoked.

In the weekends Upside Dawn transmits sounds from the kitchen to the bedroom, informing everyone who is still in bed that there is some activity in the house. This way, unawareness of each otherâ€™s awakeness will not cause them to miss out on family time anymore.

## IRIS (Project B2.2)

Ever experienced doubts before a workout? A lot of people has trouble with the dillema of doubts about staying or going. Unfortunately this will result in a high drop-out rate regarding easy-to-access sporting activities. Research has shown that whenever a women is wearing her sporting outfit she is more willing to go sporting. This part in the pre-workout routine grabbed our attention and therefore
we wanted to research this specific moment more. In this research through design project we test the influence of an interactive design in the pre-workout routine of female sporters. The hanger has different stages during the day of the sporting activity. Via a diary the participants can share their thoughts and feelings.
