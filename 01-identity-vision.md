## Vision

We live in a day and age where we are continually pushed into using products and services which are prescribed to us by big corporations. These products and services are designed with a standard definition of the user in mind. However, I believe this definition does not provide a good solution for all users. A demand for better fitting products can be seen in the various hacker and maker communities evolving around existing product ecosystems, in order to make the products provided by the big corporations better suit their indivual needs.

The maker movement is a relatively recent trend, with a wide audiance able to access a set of tools and machines which is getting cheaper and more accesible than ever before. (S. Nascimento & A. Polvora, 2016) The relationship between a maker and their technology is something which is quite complex, going further than simply expressing their creativity, their drive is often connected to a diverse set of social, economic, cultural, political and ethical factors.
I think that by means of personal adaptation, these makers are better able to express their individual vision and goals, while doing so more efficiently and effectively. It allows them to better adapt their technologies to the uniqueness of their daily encounters with them.

So while a large amount of consumers are happy to use the products and services provided by manufacterers, a response to the growing hacker and maker communities should be formulated in order to make adapting products easier. Existing solutions can already be found in the form of APIs and open source software, but this doesn't awnser the need for tangible adaption.
Devices should be able to be manipulated and modified on a physical level. If individual products would be designed more like an interconnected system of building blocks, it can more easily be adapted to the needs and requirements set by the users. If the underlying technologies and thought processes are open sourced, then individual makes or partnering companies could provide modular solutions for this emerging need to make devices unlock the users ultimate potential.

## Identity

As a child, solving puzzles and getting to know "how things work" were some of my many pleasures. From my teenage years and onward, I like to work with sewing machines and other fabrication machinery. In a nutshell, I love to make things.  
Later down the line, through my pre-existing curiosity in computers and spatial design of costumes and clothes, I adopted 3D modelling and computer-aided design. It excites me a lot to use these software packages to bridge the gap between the conceptual world in my head, modelling that in software and finally bringing it to life in the physical world. For bringing my designs into the real world I adopted the use of 3D printer technology.  
Bridging the _digital_ and the _physical_ fascinates me as a designer, especially when I can impacts the use of products in users' daily lives and routines.

During design processes there are many small puzzles and challenges to overcome. Analyzing them, figuring out solutions and getting my hands dirty while testing and prototyping is when I see my talents reach their peak potential. I'm a perseverer and I won't rest until I'm done. An good quality for persisting in getting things the way I envision them. Howerver, it can lead to tunnelvision; this is the moment that I realise that I benefit from the dynamics of working in a team. Every now and then, whenever I drift off course from the main course, I need others to pull me back to earth. Also, when I see others struggle I feel a strong urge to help and coach them; and share my knowledge and expertise to help them succeed. Together you are smarter than one. This also helps me to stay grounded and keeps my mind active.

Whenever I am working on a new concept I tend to build on the technologies I have available to me. My strength is to realise it into a functioning artefact, even if I step into unknown territory. New technologies & tools won't stop me, it only makes it more exciting for me to work on a project because I learn a lot of new things in the process. Especially when these new technologies enrich the original design concept, I creates the driving force to never stop and push the boundaries of what I thought was possible.

In order to form a design concept to begin with, I want to explore as many opportunities and options as possible. Nothing is too far fetched, as long as it drives novel thinking and use of technology. For me exploration also means experimenting with all options possible in the amount of time I have. To validate these and to determine their impact, their feasibility and their value for the user. 

Combining existing and new technologies into something that people can embed in **their** everyday, in **their** own way, in a way that it puts a smile upon **their** face, that really inspires me and genuinely makes me happy. It takes small steps to eventually make this world a better place. I want to be an active contributor in that gradual process.
