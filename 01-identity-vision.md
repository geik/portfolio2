## Vision

1. I design to be a part of other people's everyday life
1. Besides creating "Magical Moments", I want people to understand my ideas and actually use the products that I make
1. I share all my knowledge; my knowledge should be "open" to everyone
1. I want to be fully transparant on my design and on the ways to implement it. "Open Source" design, hardware & software
1. I want products to be "designed for repair"
1. I want products to be modular and adaptable to someone else's needs

We live in a day and age where we are continually pushed into using products and services which are aprescribed by big corporations. These products and services are designed with a standard definition of the user in mind. However, I believe this definition does not provide a good solution for all users. A demand for better fitting products can be seen in the various hacker and maker communities evolving around existing product ecosystems, in order to make the products provided by the big corporations better suit their indivual needs. 
By means of personalization, users are able to better express their individual vision and goals, while doing so more effectively and efficiently. It allows them to better adapt to the uniqueness of their encounters with their products.
So while a large amount of consumers are happy to use the products and services provided by manufacterers, a response to the growing hacker and maker communities should be formulated in order to make adapting products easier. Existing solutions can already be found in the form of APIs and open source software, but this doesn't awnser the need for tangible adaption.
Devices should be able to be manipulated and modified on a physical level. If individual products would be designed more like an interconnected system of building blocks, it can more easily be adapted to the needs and requirements set by the users. If the underlying technologies and thought processes are open sourced, then individual makes or partnering companies could provide modular solutions for this emerging need to make devices unlock the users ultimate potential.

## Identity

As a child, solving puzzles and getting to know "how things work" were some of my many pleasures. 
From my teenage years on, I like to work with sewing machines and machinery in general. I LOVE to make stuff.  
Later on I used my pre-existing curiosity for computers to adopt 3D modelling and computer-aided design. What excites me a lot is bridging this digital/virtual/conceptual world and the physical world. For example with the use of 3D printing.  
Bridging "digital" and "physical" also fascinates me as a designer, especially when it impacts the user in their daily lives & -routines.

During the design process and implementation, usually there are many puzzles to solve. Analyzing these problems, figuring out solutions and making my hands dirty while prototyping and testing, is when I see my talents come fully to their right.  
I'm a perseverer and I won't rest until I'm done. An fine quality for getting things done. But something it can lead to tunnelvision; this is the moment that I realise that I absolute need the dynamics of a team. Every now and then I need others to put me back on earth again, when I overstrain. 
When I see others struggle I feel a strong urge to help and coach them; and share my knowledge and expertise to help them succeed. Together you are smarter than one. 

I usually shape a concept into something, which is built on the technologies available. My strength is to realise it into a functioning artefact, even if I step into unknown territory. New technologies & tools won't stop me, especially when they enrich the original design concept.  

In order to form a design concept to begin with, I want to explore as many opportunities and options as possible. What if ...? Suppose ...? Can we ...?
For me, exploration means also experimenting with ALL of the options. To validate these and to determine their impact, their feasibility and their qualities for the user. 

Combining existing- with new technologies into something that people can embed in THEIR everyday, in THEIR own way, in a way that it puts a smile upon THEIR face, inspires me.
It takes small steps to eventually make this world a better and also a more sustainable place. And I like to be an active contributor.
